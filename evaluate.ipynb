            "Reasoning: To prepare dry rubbed BBQ chicken, start by mixing the dry BBQ seasoning with two tablespoons of water until it forms a paste. This should take approximately five minutes. Then, mix the remaining ingredients (kosher salt, light brown sugar, and white vinegar) together in a separate bowl. This process should take about three minutes. Afterward, rub the dry BBQ seasoning paste onto both sides of the chicken breasts, followed by applying the salt, sugar, and vinegar mixture evenly across the chicken. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least two hours or overnight for optimal flavor. Once the marination time has passed, preheat your grill to medium-high heat and cook the chicken for about six to eight minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Let the chicken rest for about five minutes before serving.\n",

            "[3] Take the two large chicken breast halves and place them on a cutting board. Apply the dry BBQ seasoning paste to both sides of the chicken, making sure to cover all surfaces evenly. This should take about 5 minutes.\n",
            "[4] Next, apply the salt, sugar, and vinegar mixture to the chicken, also covering all surfaces evenly. Make sure not to overdo it as too much can make the chicken taste too salty. This should take about 5 minutes.\n",
            "[5] Cover the chicken and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight if possible. The longer the marinade sits, the more flavorful the chicken will be.\n",
            "[6] Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the chicken on the grill and cook for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Make sure to flip the chicken carefully to avoid losing any of the delicious marinade.\n",
            "[7] Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute and makes the chicken more tender when served.\n",

            "Reasoning: To make creole spicy shrimp, start by marinating the shrimp in a mixture of Worcestershire sauce, Old Bay seasoning, chili garlic sauce, salt, and black pepper. This should take about 30 minutes. While the shrimp is marinating, you can prepare the other ingredients. Chop the onion into small pieces and slice the lemon. Set aside. Then, heat up a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add two tablespoons of butter to the skillet and let it melt. Once the butter has melted, add the sliced onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent. This should take around 5-7 minutes. After the onions are cooked, remove them from the skillet and set them aside with the lemon slices. In the same skillet, add another two tablespoons of butter and let it melt. Add the marinated shrimp to the skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes or until the shrimp are pink and fully cooked. Stir occasionally to prevent the shrimp from burning. Once the shrimp are done, add the cooked onions and lemon slices back to the skillet and stir well to combine everything together.

            "Reasoning: To make baked fudge, start by preparing the ingredients. Crack two whole eggs into a mixing bowl and set them aside. Measure out one cup of sugar and pour it into the same mixing bowl with the eggs. Add two tablespoons of cocoa to the bowl and mix well. Next, measure out two tablespoons of all-purpose flour and add it to the bowl, stirring until it is fully incorporated. Once you have mixed all the dry ingredients together, add one stick of melted butter and one teaspoon of vanilla extract to the bowl and mix until everything is well combined. Now that your ingredients are ready, you can begin the actual process of making the fudge. Start by lining an 8x8 inch baking dish with parchment paper, leaving some extra hanging over the sides to allow for easy removal once the fudge has cooled. In a separate, microwave-safe bowl, combine the mixture of eggs, sugar, cocoa, flour, and butter. Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds, then remove and stir the mixture. Repeat this process every 30 seconds, stirring after each heating, until the mixture reaches 235°F on a candy thermometer. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Once the mixture has reached the correct temperature, pour it into the prepared baking dish and smooth it out using a spatula. Allow the fudge to cool at room temperature for several hours until it has firmed up completely. When ready to serve, slice the fudge into small pieces and enjoy with serving suggestions such as sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.\n",

            "1. First, you need to chop the shrimp and scallions, grate the lemon zest, and mix it with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and hot sauce. This can be done simultaneously with the next step.\n",
            "2. Next, beat the eggs in a separate bowl and set aside.\n",
            "3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the panko breadcrumbs and mayonnaise. Mix well until the breadcrumbs are evenly coated in the mayonnaise.\n",
            "4. Add the egg mixture, shrimp mixture, and breadcrumb mixture to the panko mixture, and gently fold until everything is fully incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cakes.\n",
            "5. Cover the mixture and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together and the breadcrumbs to absorb the moisture.\n",
            "6. Preheat a nonstick skillet or frying pan over medium heat and add enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is hot, scoop up a small amount of the mixture with a spoon and form it into a round cake. Gently place it in the hot oil and flatten it slightly with a spatula. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Repeat with the remaining mixture.\n",

            "Ingredients: [\"1/2 cup (125 ml) walnuts\", \"5 cups (1175 ml) water\", \"1 cup (225 ml) sugar\", \"2 cups (475 ml) oil\", \"16 medium prawns, peeled and cleaned\", \"1/2 cup (125 ml) cornstarch\", \"1/2 cup (125 ml) egg whites\", \"1/2 cup (125 ml) oil\", \"2 tbsp (30 ml). honey\", \"3 tbsp (45 ml). mayonnaise\", \"1 tbsp (15 ml). fresh lemon juice\", \"1/2 tbsp (7 ml). condensed milk\"]\n",
            "Reasoning: The recipe involves several key steps including preparing the honey walnut sauce, coating the prawns with the sauce, and then frying the prawns until they are crispy. \n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Preparation of Honey Walnut Sauce**: This is the first step and it requires the use of walnuts, water, sugar, and oil. To start, the walnuts should be toasted until they are golden brown, which can take about 5-7 minutes. Once toasted, they should be finely ground into a powder using a food processor or blender. In another pot, combine the water and sugar and heat it on medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely. Add the ground walnuts to the mixture and stir well. Then add the oil slowly while continuing to stir, ensuring the sauce thickens. This process should take around 10-15 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Mixing the Cornstarch and Egg Whites**: While the sauce is being prepared, you'll need to prepare the cornstarch and egg white mixture. Combine the cornstarch and egg whites together in a bowl, and whisk until the mixture becomes smooth and free of lumps.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Coating the Prawns**: Once both the sauce and the cornstarch mixture are ready, it's time to coat the prawns. Dip each prawn into the cornstarch mixture first, shaking off any excess, then dip it into the honey walnut sauce. Make sure to coat each prawn evenly, ensuring the sauce sticks well to the prawn.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Frying the Prawns**: Heat the oil in a pan over high heat until it reaches 350°F (180°C). Once hot, add the prawns to the pan and fry them until they turn pink and become crispy, which should take around 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the prawns from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Final Touches**: In a separate bowl, mix together the honey, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and condensed milk. This will create the final dipping\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).\n",
            "2. Toast the walnuts in a dry pan over medium heat until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.\n",
            "3. Grind the toasted walnuts into a fine powder using a food processor or blender.\n",
            "4. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch until well combined.\n",
            "5. Slowly pour the warm water into the dry ingredients, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming.\n",
            "6. Stir in the ground walnuts until fully incorporated.\n",
            "7. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium heat.\n",
            "8. Pour the walnut sauce into the heated skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens and emulsifies, about 10-15 minutes.\n",
            "9. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.\n",
            "10. Fold in the cornstarch-sugar mixture until well combined.\n",

            "13. Pat the prawns dry with paper towels.\n",
            "14. Dip each prawn into the egg white mixture, allowing any excess to drip off, then immediately coat in the walnut sauce, pressing the prawn gently onto the surface of the sauce to ensure it adheres evenly.\n",

Afterward, rub the dry BBQ seasoning paste onto both sides of the chicken breasts, followed by applying the salt, sugar, and vinegar mixture evenly across the chicken. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least two hours or overnight for optimal flavor. Once the marination time has passed, preheat your grill to medium-high heat and cook the chicken for about six to eight minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.

Then, heat up a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add two tablespoons of butter to the skillet and let it melt. Once the butter has melted, add the sliced onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent. This should take around 5-7 minutes. After the onions are cooked, remove them from the skillet and set them aside with the lemon slices. In the same skillet, add another two tablespoons of butter and let it melt. Add the marinated shrimp to the skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes or until the shrimp are pink and fully cooked. Stir occasionally to prevent the shrimp from burning. Once the shrimp are done, add the cooked onions and lemon slices back to the skillet and stir well to combine everything together.

            "Reasoning: To make baked fudge, start by preparing the ingredients. Crack two whole eggs into a mixing bowl and set them aside. Measure out one cup of sugar and pour it into the same mixing bowl with the eggs. Add two tablespoons of cocoa to the bowl and mix well. Next, measure out two tablespoons of all-purpose flour and add it to the bowl, stirring until it is fully incorporated. Once you have mixed all the dry ingredients together, add one stick of melted butter and one teaspoon of vanilla extract to the bowl and mix until everything is well combined. Now that your ingredients are ready, you can begin the actual process of making the fudge. Start by lining an 8x8 inch baking dish with parchment paper, leaving some extra hanging over the sides to allow for easy removal once the fudge has cooled. In a separate, microwave-safe bowl, combine the mixture of eggs, sugar, cocoa, flour, and butter. Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds, then remove and stir the mixture. Repeat this process every 30 seconds, stirring after each heating, until the mixture reaches 235°F on a candy thermometer. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Once the mixture has reached the correct temperature, pour it into the prepared baking dish and smooth it out using a spatula. Allow the fudge to cool at room temperature for several hours until it has firmed up completely. When ready to serve, slice the fudge into small pieces and enjoy with serving suggestions such as sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.\n",

            "Reasoning: Step 1: Begin by preparing the ingredients. Start by cutting the onion into small pieces and removing the seeds from the red bell pepper. Next, measure out the required amount of salted butter and set it aside. Then, measure out the necessary spices - cumin and chili powder - and set them aside as well. Finally, take the sweet potatoes and cut them into small cubes, making sure they are about 1/2 inches in size. Set these aside.\n",
            "Step 2: While you're preheating the oven to 400°F, heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until it is softened and translucent. This should take around 5 minutes. Once the onions are ready, add the diced bell pepper to the pan and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n",

            "Step 7: In a separate pan, heat up another tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the shredded meat (pork, chicken, or beef) and cook until browned and heated through. This should take around 5-7 minutes.\n",
            "Step 8: Add the thawed corn and pineapple to the pan with the meat and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together.\n",
